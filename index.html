        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hudson Walter. I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Missouri with a passion for cybersecurity, engineering, and sports. [cite: 1]</p>

        <h3>My Purpose and Goals</h3>
        <p>My name is Hudson Walter. I am from Leawood, KS and I am a freshman at the University of Missouri. In high school, I was part of First Robotics Competition (FRC) robotics and National Honors Society. Our robotics team, FRC 2410 got 3rd place at the Kansas City regional. I like to listen to country music and watch sports such as football and basketball. I am currently majoring in Computer Science and I plan on working in the cyber security field when I graduate. I hope to have a 3.5 GPA and to have an internship before graduating. My main goals are to travel the world and explore different cultures and I hope to get a job in Denver, Colorado. My family grew up in Colorado and my favorite sports teams are the Denver Broncos and Nuggets. I also want to learn to ski or snowboard up in the mountains if I move to Denver. [cite: 1]</p>
